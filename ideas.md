# Battle Royale climb

## Current state

- League: Battle Royale, Coworld `battleroyale` v0.1.13.
- Player: Andre von Houck (`ply_607f17a2-3acf-405b-91fe-d12ef1001c00`).
- Submitted policy: `andre-battleroyale:v1`.
- Upstream policy base: `a39eb196131ac0083506bb344130359de1c2d9c8`.

## Backlog

- Switch only the FFA doctrine from legacy to hunter.
- Add only a conservative hunter ring-safety margin.
- Shorten only the hunter opening arm-trip deadline.
- Reduce only the hunter arm-trip detour radius.
- Switch only the FFA doctrine from legacy to passive.
- Switch only the FFA doctrine from legacy to shade.
- Switch only the FFA doctrine from legacy to pact.
- Inspect hosted artifacts for avoidable unarmed time, ring damage, and
  target-contact gaps, then add one evidence-backed idea at a time.

## Trial log

### Trial 1: hunter doctrine default

- Idea: The newly added hunter doctrine should outperform the legacy example
  by arming early, pursuing weaker targets, and closing sooner in the late game.
- Change: When `CTF_BOT_FFA_DOCTRINE` is unset, select `FfaHunter` instead of
  `FfaLegacy`. No hunter parameter is changed.
- Isolation: Passed. `tools/extract_doctrine.nim` ran the compiled policy with
  the doctrine environment variable removed and captured
  `ffaDoctrine=hunter`, `ffaHunterArm=true`, and `ffaHunterPursuit=true`.
- Artifact: `andre-battleroyale:v2`, policy version
  `6e71ddba-557d-4f19-861e-3add5441f0d9`.
- XP id: Baseline `xreq_dcc0888b-4175-4fbd-9a17-1dd04dcc48d5`;
  candidate `xreq_8a17f619-bfc0-432c-a4da-4df7fbb5af4d`.
- Opponents: At Andre's #11 MMR of 1435, the three nearest other players were
  David Greis (`Battle Royale Baseline:v1`, 1441), sivannn
  (`sivan-br-ringsurfer:v1`, 1470), and NanosaurusX (`nancy-br:v1`, 1479).
  Both requests pin this exact field, use four agents, rotate seats, and run 10
  hosted episodes.
- Verdict: Pending hosted XP significance.

### Bootstrap 0: current example champion

- Idea: Establish a working submitted champion before experiments.
- Change: No behavior change. Build the current upstream
  `players/baseline/baseline.nim` example with its default legacy FFA doctrine.
- Artifact: `andre-battleroyale:v1`, policy version
  `ecaaf746-1b7c-46f8-a66b-746bd192be7a`, submission
  `sub_6df85778-353f-4e4c-baac-9b8b20af7019`.
- XP id: N/A. There is no submitted policy to use as a baseline.
- Opponents: N/A. The initial champion is the explicit no-submission bootstrap.
- Verdict: Kept as the initial champion. The submission placed successfully and
  its league membership is active.
